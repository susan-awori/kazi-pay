KaziPay is an escrow platform for Kenya’s gig economy – currently under development for the M‑Pesa Africa x GOMYCODE Hackathon 2026.



##  Problem

Kenya’s informal workers (5M+) face a two‑sided trust gap: workers fear non‑payment; clients fear paying upfront for poor work.

##  Solution

We’re building a web‑based escrow system using M‑Pesa STK Push and B2C. Clients deposit funds, workers accept jobs, and payment is released only after client confirmation.

Authentication & Roles

- Users register/login with **phone number (OTP)** or **email/password**.
- JWT tokens secure all API requests.
- Roles: `client`, `worker`, or `both`.

**Test accounts** (use in the live demo):
- Client: `254711000001` (phone) / `SecureK@zi99!` / `client`
- Worker: `254711000002` (phone) / `SecureK@zi99!` / `worker`



##  Tech Stack (Planned)

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Backend  | Django, Python |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Frontend | React, Vite |
| M‑Pesa   | Daraja API (STK Push, B2C) |
| SMS      | Africa’s Talking |


##  Core Features

-  **Secure Authentication** – Register/login with phone number (OTP) or email/password. JWT tokens secure all API requests. Roles: Client, Worker, or Both.

-  **M‑Pesa Escrow Payments** – Clients pay via STK Push; funds are held until the job is completed. Workers receive payment instantly via B2C after client confirmation.

-  **Job Management** – Clients post jobs with description, amount, and target worker. Workers view and accept available jobs. Clients confirm completion to release payment.

-  **Real‑time SMS Notifications** – Africa’s Talking sends SMS updates at every key step: payment received, job accepted, payment released.

-  **Auto‑Release Mechanism** – If the client does not confirm within 48 hours of worker acceptance, the system automatically pays the worker (protects workers from unresponsive clients).

-  **Transaction History** – Every deposit and payout is logged in a transaction model for full transparency.

-  **Dual‑Role Dashboards** – Separate interfaces for clients (post jobs, track active jobs, confirm completion) and workers (browse available jobs, see accepted jobs, track earnings).

-  **Responsive Web Interface** – Built with React and Tailwind CSS, works seamlessly on desktop and mobile.
